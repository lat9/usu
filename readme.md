Ultimate URLs (a.k.a. _USU_) allows store owners to use alternate URLs. The URLs generated will include &quot;human friendly&quot; names in the user's browser's requested language and contain shortened versions of certain parameters.

v3.0.0 and later supports stores based on Zen Cart versions 1.5.5 and later and requires **no** core-file overwrites.

**Note**: If you are updating _USU_ from a version _prior to_ v3.0.0, there are, unfortunately, some hand-edits required to remove those previous versions' changes to Zen Cart **core files**.  See [here](./pages/upgrade_from_v2.md) for additional information.
